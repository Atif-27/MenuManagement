## Setup

1. Clone this repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Atif-27/MenuManagement.git
   ```

2. Change Directory

   ```bash
   cd MenuManagement
   ```

3. Install dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set Up your env file (This is supposed to be hidden)

    ```env
    DB_URI="mongodb+srv://atif276ali:LbV6eSZ0PrPCEnMV@cluster0.f0lmo.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0"
    PORT=8000
    ```

5. Run the server.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. You can now use Postman or any API client to interact with the server. Here is my postman collection

8. Paste the URL in initial and current value of the environment in case of error
    ```bash
    http://localhost:8000/api/v1
    ```

## Short Answers

- **Which database have you chosen and why?**
  I have chosen MongoDB because of its flexibility with JSON-like documents, scalability, and ease of use, which aligns well with the dynamic nature of menu management data.

- **3 things that you learned from this assignment?**

  - Enhanced my understanding of building RESTful APIs with Express.js.
  - Gained experience in schema validation using Zod.
  - Learned more about managing relationships between MongoDB collections.

- **What was the most difficult part of the assignment?**
  Designing and implementing the database schema to handle the relationships between categories, subcategories, and items efficiently.

- **What would you have done differently given more time?**
  Given more time, I would have integrated multer for image uploads, used Cloudinary for image storage, implemented pagination for limiting API responses, and added sorting capabilities for better data organization and scalability.
